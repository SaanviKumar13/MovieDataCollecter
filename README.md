# Movie Data Collector

This project utilizes BeautifulSoup to scrape movie data from IMDb (Internet Movie Database).
It extracts information such as movie title, release year, runtime, certificate, votes, rating and description and 
stores it in an excel file.

It is a simple web scraper that scrapes only one webpage and it gives 100 rows of data.
